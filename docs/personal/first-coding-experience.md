# My First Coding Experience

I first got into coding back in **2009**, thanks to my dad who (lovingly) started pushing me to learn a new language called **Python**. At the time, I didn’t really know what I was doing — and I definitely wouldn’t have called myself a “developer” — but I slowly began learning how to write small programs and use version control tools like **Git**.

Like most beginners, I struggled with questions like:  
*“Where do I even start? What should I build? Is this project even worth it, or just another reinvention of the wheel?”*

But in the end, I didn't care. I just kept going.

Despite being self-taught, I learned a ton. And if you’re in that same place today — unsure, curious, or overwhelmed — here’s my advice: **pick a language, start small, and stay curious**. There are endless free resources online to help you learn. Pretend you’re already working in a real team — what would you build? Where would you begin?

# 🖊️ My Evolution Through Code Editors

This is actually one of my favorite rabbit holes — I’ve tried a lot of editors over the years. Some stuck. Some didn't.

## My Personal Timeline

- **`nano`** (2009 – today): My first editor. I still use it sometimes when I'm in a terminal and need to get something done fast.
- **Python 2.7 IDE** (2009): Came pre-installed with Python 2.7. It was basic, but a start.
- **Sublime Text** (2012): Loved it, but the paid license and limited plugin ecosystem eventually turned me off.
- **Atom**: Installed it, used it for 2 days, uninstalled it. It lagged like crazy. No idea why.
- **Brackets**: Used mainly for live web previews. Dropped it after ~3 months.
- **Visual Studio Code** (since 2017): The best all-around editor I’ve used. Lightweight, customizable, full of extensions.
- **Vim / Neovim** (since 2020): The finger-melting experience. Powerful once you embrace the learning curve.

# 🧪 Final Thoughts

Not sure why I started writing this today, but it’s been fun to reflect. Maybe it’s just a reminder that **growth is messy and nonlinear** — and that’s okay.

Also, if you were wondering: yes, I'm still learning English, but watching shows like *Mr. Robot* definitely helped. 12/10 recommend.
