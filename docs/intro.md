# Welcome to *Everything I Know*

This is my personal knowledge base â€” a structured, evolving collection of everything Iâ€™ve learned and continue to explore. Itâ€™s a space for clarity, synthesis, and long-term memory.

## ðŸ§  What you'll find here

This wiki is categorized into key areas I'm deeply interested in or actively working on:

- **Python Development**: patterns, libraries, best practices, clean code, automation, scripting.
- **Operating Systems**: memory management, processes, job control, IPC, shell-level tricks.
- **Web & Full Stack**: Node.js, React, REST APIs, authentication, performance.
- **Computer Science Theory**: algorithms, data structures, system design, compilers.
- **Life Notes**: learning methods, personal development, philosophy, and insights I live by.

## ðŸ“š How I use this

- As a second brain: for quick recall, deep dives, or refreshing complex concepts.
- To write better code: by documenting reusable ideas, patterns, and mistakes.
- To **never start from scratch** when revisiting a topic.
- To clarify thoughts and consolidate fragmented knowledge.

> ðŸ’¡ This wiki is not just a notebook. It's my **codex** â€” a living, growing artifact of my intellectual journey.
